# graph-rdfa-processor

### RDFa processor library (WIP)

- covers [RDFa 1.1 Primer - Third Edition](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-primer/).
- used [RDFa/Play](https://rdfa.info/play/) for omparing.
- WIP:

  - [RDFa Core](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-core/)
  - [Earl-Reports](https://rdfa.info/earl-reports/#RDFa-rdfa1.1-tests-for-html5)

  ### WIP

  The plan is to make as much tests as possible, and fix the bugs along the way.

  This results of a spaghetti nightmare that is mostly impossible to maintain.

  Once enough tests have been implemented, a full refactoring will be needed before
  doing anything else.
